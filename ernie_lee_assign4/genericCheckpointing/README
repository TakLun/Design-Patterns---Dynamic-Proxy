PURPOSE:

[
	Develop a program that uses a dynamic proxy in place of an actual defined instance of a class.
	The purpose of this assignment is to create a generic library for persistent storage of student and employee records. 
	The code should allow the conversion of objects into a wire format. 
	The code should be designed using dynamic proxies and reflection so that addition of new objects or serialization 
	formats causes minimal changes

PERCENT COMPLETE:

[
	I believe I have completed 100% of this project.
]

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:

[
	I do not believe there are parts that are not complete.
]

BUGS:

[
	None
]

FILES:

[
	StoreRestoreHandler.java, Proxy handler of the program that retrieves the method calls from the main method, and invokes them instead of having the intended object invoking them
	Driver.java, the main file associated with the genericCheckpointing program that also contains main
	RestoreI.java,Interface that retrieves information from a text file and uses them to create a new object, and returns it.
	StoreI.java, Interface that stores all relevent data from an object on to an text file in a specific format
	StoreRestoreI.java, Tag Interface
	EmployeeRecord.java, The object whose information is to be stored to a text file and restored back into an object
	StudentRecord.java, The object whose information is to be stored to a text file and restored back into an object
	ProxyCreator.java, Creates the dynamic proxy that the program uses to create objects at runtime
	SerializableObject.java, Empty base class
	SerializableList.java, List data structure that stores all the SerializableObject instances.
	README, the text file currently being read
]

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

[
	[java] EmployeeRecord objects are equal: true
     [java] StudentRecord objects are equal: true
